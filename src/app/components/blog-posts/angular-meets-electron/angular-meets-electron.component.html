      There are many great desktop apps currently running on Electron and after the release of the new Angular I was thinking to
      give it a try. The combination of two worlds can be of great potential. Desktop apps require possibilities to scale
      and Typescript seems to offer the natural answer to that. When I began working on this integration project I ended
      up going a bit further than initially expected to make the basic setup working. That is why I decided to give a short
      description of the steps that I had to do in order to make it work so that it may be a bit easier for you to kick things
      off.

      If you just want to check my setup and skip the post, go to my <a class="article-link" href="https://github.com/ubarevicius/angular-meets-electron"
        target="_blank">Angular meets Electron</a> starter. You can fork or just download the repository and use it further.

    <p> Electron code runs directly on your machine and communicates with the operating system, while Angular runs in web renderer
      as the web application. Because together they form coherent application I decided to setup the base of Electron code
      to also use Typescript as a starting point. Not to begin completely from scratch I forked the <a class="article-link"
        href="https://github.com/cmelo/angular2-electron-starter" target="_blank">cmelo’s starter project</a> and began looking
      at the setup. First thing I did was to update Angular-cli version to beta.25.5 with ahead of time compilation working.
      Angular-cli has improved quite a bit during the last few months, so this seemed an obvious direction to follow. I am
      planning to update this base further when cli will release new updates. I also changed some build configuration steps
      that were using OS dependent copy commands in package.json. As Angular uses typescript I decided that Electron should
      also use typescript. Furthermore, after reading through the provided sample application I couldn’t find some important
      communication link between Electron and Angular. Authors probably decided to let developers solve it themselves, but
      the solution was not immediately obvious and required some workarounds.

      In the video below you will see development experience that I was able to achieve with VSCode editor. To start things off
      I typed <strong>yarn run dev</strong> in my terminal. You can also use <strong>npm run dev</strong>. This builds
      Electron and starts two parallel watcher tasks by using library called <strong>concurrently</strong>. These tasks will
      be watching both Angular project and Electron typescript files for changes. To start Electron I am using launch.json
      configuration of VSCode. In <strong>Debug</strong> section I am thus able to run launch configuration named <strong>Debug main process</strong>.
      You will see later that this allows me to brake in Electron's code. Electron on development environment works with
      live reload, thus all changes to Angular will be immediately visible in Electron's window. Changes that happen in Electron
      code will require process refresh button to be clicked in debug menu. To implement full process reload on changes would
      be future improvement. When something changes on Angular code though, everything is rebuilt and chromium reloads the
      new code. I find this setup to be fast enough to be workable for the daily development. Of course there are still space
      for improvement and new ideas are welcome.

      In order to build production version you can use
      <strong>yarn run package_all</strong> command in your terminal. This will create builds for well known OS, such as
      Windows, Mac and Linux. In the video below you can see the process of building. This command first builds Typescript
      files of Electron, then via Angular-cli builds AoT version of the application bundle, which is also minified and tree-shaked.
      At the end Electron packager makes it's magic and sends the end result to <strong>dist-app-all</strong> folder.
