The field of architecture\n      is no exception. Technological innovation continuously opens new forms of artistic and functional expression.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Studio RAP (Robotics, Architecture, Production) recently received the ARC 16 award for innovation in architecture. I’m glad\n      to have an opportunity to be a part of the trip that this young start-up is taking. In this article, I’ll try to shed\n      some light on what it means to innovate the business of architecture today and how this architectural office is growing\n      to become a tech company.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Skilledin office.jpg" alt="Skilledin office" width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Skilledin office</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Skilledin office interior.jpg" alt="Skilledin office interior"\n        width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Skilledin office interior</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n      So, why do architects collaborate with programmers? What does programming have to do with architecture? Why is it so fun\n      to code geometry? How all these things lead to innovation?\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      It’s no secret that computers changed the way in which architects’ design buildings. In the last decades drawing boards were\n      replaced by rows of monitors, Oculus Rift’s and HoloLenses, but the underlying economic process remained almost intact.\n      During the last centuries, though, a bigger transition was happening and architects went from being master builders\n      to draftsmen, having extensive knowledge of catalogues containing prefabricated building components from various manufacturers.\n      Even though assembling such “Lego” parts requires creativity and ingenuity, freedom of designer to go around standards\n      deteriorated or to put it differently - grew to be very expensive. Imagining new ways of building became very difficult.\n      Rules were set and everyone became accustomed to the separation of designing and building. Architects were making drawings,\n      engineers were solving the math and fabrication was left to companies that own heavy machinery. Increased segregation\n      made collaboration very difficult. Pressured by limited budgets and time, engineers were involved only at the end of\n      design process to make sure that buildings will stand. Architects lost understanding on how machines work and what\n      are the real possibilities of manufacturing. Producers became too big to listen to requirements of relatively small\n      architectural or engineering offices and went further to use old methods of manufacturing as it involved smaller risks.\n      Companies specialized and communication failed. The central economic position and craftsmanship of the master builder\n      was lost in multiple translations and communication problems. Standardization delivered efficiency in the short term\n      but led to detachment between design, manufacturing and engineering in the long run, negatively affecting the pace\n      of innovation in the entire building industry.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Innovation of presentation, not the industry.png" alt="Innovation of presentation, not the industry"\n        width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Innovation of the presentation, not the industry</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n      Ecological, functional and performance demands of the present are pushing new businesses in the building industry to rethink\n      their position in the economy and to get out of the previously described loophole. The automotive industry suggests\n      an alternative way. Even though stagnating with its combustion engines, the communication lines between design and\n      manufacturing teams were kept short. In car producing companies, bottom up iterative design processes were developed.\n      They were based on close collaboration between all those involved. Manufacturing was pushed to use automation in new\n      and innovative ways. And although industry was using machines to make millions of “standard” cars, they succeeded in\n      developing general purpose reprogrammable robotic arms which, by design and on demand, could do different tasks continuously.\n      To architects, such general-purpose machinery opens up huge possibilities.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Studio RAP is one of the first offices to implement the automotive’s model of integrated design and fabrication in an architectural\n      company. The goal is to take back control by resurrecting idea of the master builder. Positioning a new generation\n      of computational architects, programmers and engineers together with robots at the epicentre of the building process\n      could remove those failing communication protocols described previously. It means though, that such a start-up needs\n      to do everything itself - design, engineer and manufacture. This, of course, is no simple task…\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Aggregate assembler.jpg" alt="Aggregate assembler" width="50%">\n      <figcaption>Aggregate assembler</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n      In order to achieve all this, one has to understand the computational nature of geometry, physical properties of materials,\n      intricacies, possibilities and limitations of manufacturing machines and more. CAD (Computer Aided Design) software,\n      used by almost all architectural offices nowadays allows designers to make virtual geometries, but these programs,\n      designed through expert system methodologies are quite limiting. Developed 3D models are mostly used to produce visualizations\n      of virtual environments for clients and to derive architectural drawings for builders. But computers are able to do\n      much more than that. New generation of CAD software opens up its API’s (Application Programming Interfaces) to more\n      advanced use cases. Algorithmic thinking becomes crucial there. These entry points liberate users from the restrictions\n      of enclosed interface possibilities and allow new kinds of creative parametric scenarios that can integrate materiality\n      and production process into one synchronized design environment.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Back to the core.png" alt="Back to the core" width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Back to the core</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n      Furthermore, manufacturing machines are driven by programs. Robots do not understand designer’s intent, section blueprints\n      or even CAD geometry until someone feeds them code, which represents movement instructions. The mentioned API’s become\n      crucial when one wants to do non-standard things with their software packages and open communication streams from CAD\n      software to robot controllers. Through programming Studio RAP is able to translate the design intent to the language\n      that the machines can understand. From the beginning of design, computational architects and programmers are aware\n      of the processes that will be involved in manufacturing and assembly of building components. The team prepares projects\n      in a way so that computed geometries can be directly processed into robot movement instructions. This requires close\n      and immediate collaboration between many specialists. And programmers are very welcome in this picture. Such work involves\n      deep understanding of procedural solvers that take structures of geometry as an input and compute various optimized\n      paths for machines to cut. This work is fun and emotionally rewarding as code is being outputted in a form of produced\n      geometry or a building. Bugs also acquire a very different meaning here. But let’s leave this theme for some other\n      time.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Assembling Skilledin Office.jpg" alt="Assembling Skilledin Office"\n        width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Assembling Skilledin Office</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>The ARC16 Innovation Award was awarded to Studio RAP for their Skilledin office in the RDM Innovation Dock in Rotterdam.\n      This parametrically designed object embodies ideas I talked about in this article. The jury found the direction appealing\n      and I couldn’t agree more. Studio RAP took a big risk in making something so complex and by realizing it within the\n      budget constraints of the client as their first project. The team used refurbished second hand robots and experimented\n      a lot to design all those unique panels that fit together perfectly in forming an optimized vault structure. The journey\n      did not end there of course. The studio is developing software that drives industrial robots. It recently released\n      the first version of RAPCAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software that helps other designers to get started using\n      robots more easily. Through software, the studio transforms the research into more abstract and reusable workflows\n      and general algorithms. You can find more information on http://rapcam.eu. Studio RAP currently experiments with many\n      different techniques of manufacturing. This will allow the office to create even more amazing projects. Being probably\n      the first architectural office having programmers in the team, Studio RAP is moving fast to become a tech company.\n      I am very happy to witness such a transition and to have the opportunity to collaborate with this young start-up.

This opens very interesting possibilities for\n      non-blocking canvas model architecture. Currently Grasshopper is built with the idea of synchronously executing streams\n      of computing blocks, but component can also execute parallel tasks. Such methodology allows not only for multithreaded\n      computing, but also for calls to be made to REST endpoints or other types of web services. In this blog post I will\n      explain my findings when dealing with such async components for RAPCAM.\n    </p>\n    <p>As .Net 4 and current Grasshopper implementation puts some limitations on asynchronous tasks, one should be careful when\n      implementing such solutions, but let’s just begin with some basic pseudocode for SolveInstance method\n    </p>\n    <pre>\n    <code class="cs">\n    {{codeSample}}\n  </code>\n  </pre>\n    <p>As you can see there are some implications for simplicity in such a component. I was not able to use DA.SetData directly\n      in RanToCompletion code block as it left dependant components unable to receive resolved data (resultPolyline). The\n      only working solution was to expire both the solution and active canvas document when task was finished. This triggers\n      SolveInstance again with the different state, reflected by skipSolution boolean and solved resultPolyline. All dependent\n      components then are able to pick up resulting polyline and correctly recompute. This does not seem to affect unrelated\n      components.\n    </p>\n    <p>Gap logic had to be disabled as that was forcing my component to output branched list of null and polyline values. By\n      changing Nickname of component one can easily inform the user that component is executing. It is of course possible\n      to add nice spinners or other progress indicators when writing such components, but it was not my intention to do such\n      a thing.\n    </p>\n    <p>componentBusy variable allows to protect component from recomputing itself when context changes. This can be improved\n      with richer state mechanism, which could allow in some specific situations to cancel the thread and recalculate solution,\n      etc.\n    </p>\n    <img src="/assets/blog-images/async-grasshopper-components/rapcam-roughning.gif" alt="rapcam roughning" width="100%">\n    <p>\n      This example gif shows the principle and actual implications of such component. \n      As you can see, thread does not block user interface. No external components get corrupt. \n      Component isolates it’s own state till calculation is finished. User is thus able to use rhino and grasshopper \n      further while calculation is done.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Using multiple interdependant components would require more complex state mechanism, but this shows the principle without overcomplicating the idea. \n      It was not my intention to give all the answers here as I have not yet delved into all the consequences of such architecture, \n      rather I prefer to introduce the idea of async component and ask community to reflect on it. We should be critical about such a pattern, \n      but its’ performance implications are hard to neglect.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</app-blog-post>'},814:function(e,t){e.exports='<div class="jumbotron">\n  <img src="/assets/cover.png" width="100%" />\n</div>\n\n<div class="row marketing">\n  <div class="col-lg-6">\n    <div routerLink="arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation">\n      <app-arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation [isSummary]="true"></app-arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class="col-lg-6">\n    <div routerLink="async-grasshopper-components">\n      <app-async-grasshopper-components [isSummary]="true"></app-async-grasshopper-components>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>'},845:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n(478)}},[845]);
