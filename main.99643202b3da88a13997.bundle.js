When I began working on this integration project I ended up going a bit\n      further than initially expected to make the basic setup working. That is why I decided to give a short description\n      of the steps that I had to do in order to make it work so that it may be a bit easier for you to kick things off.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      If you just want to check my setup and skip the post, go to my <a class="article-link" href="https://github.com/ubarevicius/angular-meets-electron"\n        target="_blank">Angular meets Electron</a> starter. You can fork or just download the repository and use it further.\n    </p>\n    <p> Electron code runs directly on your machine and communicates with the operating system, while Angular runs in web renderer\n      as the web application. Because together they form coherent application I decided to setup the base of Electron code\n      to also use Typescript as a starting point. Not to begin completely from scratch I forked the <a class="article-link"\n        href="https://github.com/cmelo/angular2-electron-starter" target="_blank">cmelo’s starter project</a> and began looking\n      at the setup. First thing I did was to update Angular-cli version to beta.25.5 with ahead of time compilation working.\n      Angular-cli has improved quite a bit during the last few months, so this seemed an obvious direction to follow. I am\n      planning to update this base further when cli will release new updates. I also changed some build configuration steps\n      that were using OS dependent copy commands in package.json. As Angular uses typescript I decided that Electron should\n      also use typescript. Furthermore, after reading through the provided sample application I couldn’t find some important\n      communication link between Electron and Angular. Authors probably decided to let developers solve it themselves, but\n      the solution was not immediately obvious and required some workarounds.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the video below you will see development experience that I was able to achieve with VSCode editor. To start things off\n      I typed <strong>yarn run dev</strong> in my terminal. You can also use <strong>npm run dev</strong>. This builds\n      Electron and starts two parallel watcher tasks by using library called <strong>concurrently</strong>. These tasks will\n      be watching both Angular project and Electron typescript files for changes. To start Electron I am using launch.json\n      configuration of VSCode. In <strong>Debug</strong> section I am thus able to run launch configuration named <strong>Debug main process</strong>.\n      You will see later that this allows me to brake in Electron\'s code. Electron on development environment works with\n      live reload, thus all changes to Angular will be immediately visible in Electron\'s window. Changes that happen in Electron\n      code will require process refresh button to be clicked in debug menu. To implement full process reload on changes would\n      be future improvement. When something changes on Angular code though, everything is rebuilt and chromium reloads the\n      new code. I find this setup to be fast enough to be workable for the daily development. Of course there are still space\n      for improvement and new ideas are welcome.\n    </p>\n    <figure>\n      <a href="/assets/blog-images/angular-meets-electron/the use of angular and electron.gif" target="_blank">\n        <img src="/assets/blog-images/angular-meets-electron/the use of angular and electron.gif" alt="The use of angular and electron"\n          width="100%">\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Development experience of Angular and Electron</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n      In order to build production version you can use\n      <strong>yarn run package_all</strong> command in your terminal. This will create builds for well known OS, such as\n      Windows, Mac and Linux. In the video below you can see the process of building. This command first builds Typescript\n      files of Electron, then via Angular-cli builds AoT version of the application bundle, which is also minified and tree-shaked.\n      At the end Electron packager makes it\'s magic and sends the end result to <strong>dist-app-all</strong> folder.\n    </p>\n    <figure>\n      <a href="/assets/blog-images/angular-meets-electron/package electron app.gif" target="_blank">\n        <img src="/assets/blog-images/angular-meets-electron/package electron app.gif" alt="Package Electron App" width="100%">\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Package Electron App</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n      I hope you now got some feeling on how this setup works. Now I will explain what I had to do to get Electron instance into\n      the Angular. I could not find any easy way to import Electron in the natural Typescript way, so I followed the solution\n      described in this <a class="article-link" href="http://electron.rocks/angular2-electron/" target="_blank">Electron rocks</a>      blog post. In my <strong>index.html</strong> I thus defined electron variable, installed Electron typings and wrote\n      integration service in angular that exposes the type safe electron variable. I understand that this is not an optimal\n      solution, so if someone will provide a better answer I\'ll be more than happy to merge it into my codebase. For a time\n      being this provides a workable setup.\n    </p>\n\n    <pre>\n    <code class="html">\n    {{indexHtml}}\n  </code>\n  </pre>\n    <p>\n      As mentioned previously, <strong>integration.service.ts</strong> just needs to declare the variable that is already\n      sitting in the global namespace to reference it. We further use it to access Electron\'s functionality.\n    </p>\n    <pre>\n    <code class="ts">\n    {{integrationService}}\n  </code>\n  </pre>\n    <p>\n      After this is done, we are able to move on and in <strong>app.component.ts</strong> just inject the integration service,\n      get Electron instance and use it\'s constituent parts. You can also see how to make everything type safe and get intellisense.\n      From Electron we need renderer to listen for events that are triggered in Electron code. To communicate back to Electron\n      I used currentWindow property. It is used in clickButton event handler. I guarantee there are other ways to send messages\n      back and forth between Angular and Electron, but this is a base <strong>IPC</strong> communication line that works.\n    </p>\n    <pre>\n    <code class="ts">\n    {{appComponent}}\n  </code>\n  </pre>\n    <p>\n      <strong>app.component.html</strong> template just renders the message that comes from Electron and binds clickButton\n      event handler of the button element.\n    </p>\n    <pre>\n    <code class="html">\n    {{appComponentTemplate}}\n  </code>\n  </pre>\n    <p>\n      Finally the Electron <strong>main.ts</strong> file holds the base setup that does Electron side communication. It also\n      uses typings. As you can see, if electron environment variable is set to development, we enable live reload. Otherwise\n      the whole <strong>electron-reload</strong> library remains unloaded. Furhter on in the code, while creating the application\n      window we send some events to angular and register listeners for events that come from Angular code.\n    </p>\n    <pre>\n    <code class="ts">\n    {{electronCode}}\n  </code>\n  </pre>\n    <p>\n      I suppose this is just enough code to make it a bit clearer what the <a class="article-link" href="https://github.com/ubarevicius/angular-meets-electron"\n        target="_blank">Angular meets Electron</a> starter setup offers you for the first beginning. I will be analyzing these\n      technologies further, so expect also for improvements to be made on this base implementation. Hopefully new posts will\n      follow on related topics. But for now, thanks for reading and good luck when using Anuglar and Electron together!\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</app-blog-post>'},815:function(e,n){e.exports='<app-blog-post title="ARC 16, Studio RAP and Technological Innovation" subtitle="" [isSummary]="isSummary">\n  <div class="summary" *ngIf="isSummary">\n    <p>Every company is a tech company.

I’m glad\n      to have an opportunity to be a part of the trip that this young start-up is taking. In this article, I’ll try to shed\n      some light on what it means to innovate the business of architecture today and how this architectural office is growing\n      to become a tech company.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Skilledin office.jpg" alt="Skilledin office" width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Skilledin office</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Skilledin office interior.jpg" alt="Skilledin office interior"\n        width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Skilledin office interior</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n      So, why do architects collaborate with programmers? What does programming have to do with architecture? Why is it so fun\n      to code geometry? How all these things lead to innovation?\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      It’s no secret that computers changed the way in which architects’ design buildings. In the last decades drawing boards were\n      replaced by rows of monitors, Oculus Rift’s and HoloLenses, but the underlying economic process remained almost intact.\n      During the last centuries, though, a bigger transition was happening and architects went from being master builders\n      to draftsmen, having extensive knowledge of catalogues containing prefabricated building components from various manufacturers.\n      Even though assembling such “Lego” parts requires creativity and ingenuity, freedom of designer to go around standards\n      deteriorated or to put it differently - grew to be very expensive. Imagining new ways of building became very difficult.\n      Rules were set and everyone became accustomed to the separation of designing and building. Architects were making drawings,\n      engineers were solving the math and fabrication was left to companies that own heavy machinery. Increased segregation\n      made collaboration very difficult. Pressured by limited budgets and time, engineers were involved only at the end of\n      design process to make sure that buildings will stand. Architects lost understanding on how machines work and what\n      are the real possibilities of manufacturing. Producers became too big to listen to requirements of relatively small\n      architectural or engineering offices and went further to use old methods of manufacturing as it involved smaller risks.\n      Companies specialized and communication failed. The central economic position and craftsmanship of the master builder\n      was lost in multiple translations and communication problems. Standardization delivered efficiency in the short term\n      but led to detachment between design, manufacturing and engineering in the long run, negatively affecting the pace\n      of innovation in the entire building industry.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Innovation of presentation, not the industry.png" alt="Innovation of presentation, not the industry"\n        width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Innovation of the presentation, not the industry</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n      Ecological, functional and performance demands of the present are pushing new businesses in the building industry to rethink\n      their position in the economy and to get out of the previously described loophole. The automotive industry suggests\n      an alternative way. Even though stagnating with its combustion engines, the communication lines between design and\n      manufacturing teams were kept short. In car producing companies, bottom up iterative design processes were developed.\n      They were based on close collaboration between all those involved. Manufacturing was pushed to use automation in new\n      and innovative ways. And although industry was using machines to make millions of “standard” cars, they succeeded in\n      developing general purpose reprogrammable robotic arms which, by design and on demand, could do different tasks continuously.\n      To architects, such general-purpose machinery opens up huge possibilities.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Studio RAP is one of the first offices to implement the automotive’s model of integrated design and fabrication in an architectural\n      company. The goal is to take back control by resurrecting idea of the master builder. Positioning a new generation\n      of computational architects, programmers and engineers together with robots at the epicentre of the building process\n      could remove those failing communication protocols described previously. It means though, that such a start-up needs\n      to do everything itself - design, engineer and manufacture. This, of course, is no simple task…\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Aggregate assembler.jpg" alt="Aggregate assembler" width="50%">\n      <figcaption>Aggregate assembler</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n      In order to achieve all this, one has to understand the computational nature of geometry, physical properties of materials,\n      intricacies, possibilities and limitations of manufacturing machines and more. CAD (Computer Aided Design) software,\n      used by almost all architectural offices nowadays allows designers to make virtual geometries, but these programs,\n      designed through expert system methodologies are quite limiting. Developed 3D models are mostly used to produce visualizations\n      of virtual environments for clients and to derive architectural drawings for builders. But computers are able to do\n      much more than that. New generation of CAD software opens up its API’s (Application Programming Interfaces) to more\n      advanced use cases. Algorithmic thinking becomes crucial there. These entry points liberate users from the restrictions\n      of enclosed interface possibilities and allow new kinds of creative parametric scenarios that can integrate materiality\n      and production process into one synchronized design environment.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Back to the core.png" alt="Back to the core" width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Back to the core</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>\n      Furthermore, manufacturing machines are driven by programs. Robots do not understand designer’s intent, section blueprints\n      or even CAD geometry until someone feeds them code, which represents movement instructions. The mentioned API’s become\n      crucial when one wants to do non-standard things with their software packages and open communication streams from CAD\n      software to robot controllers. Through programming Studio RAP is able to translate the design intent to the language\n      that the machines can understand. From the beginning of design, computational architects and programmers are aware\n      of the processes that will be involved in manufacturing and assembly of building components. The team prepares projects\n      in a way so that computed geometries can be directly processed into robot movement instructions. This requires close\n      and immediate collaboration between many specialists. And programmers are very welcome in this picture. Such work involves\n      deep understanding of procedural solvers that take structures of geometry as an input and compute various optimized\n      paths for machines to cut. This work is fun and emotionally rewarding as code is being outputted in a form of produced\n      geometry or a building. Bugs also acquire a very different meaning here. But let’s leave this theme for some other\n      time.\n    </p>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation/Assembling Skilledin Office.jpg" alt="Assembling Skilledin Office"\n        width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Assembling Skilledin Office</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <p>The ARC16 Innovation Award was awarded to Studio RAP for their Skilledin office in the RDM Innovation Dock in Rotterdam.\n      This parametrically designed object embodies ideas I talked about in this article. The jury found the direction appealing\n      and I couldn’t agree more. Studio RAP took a big risk in making something so complex and by realizing it within the\n      budget constraints of the client as their first project. The team used refurbished second hand robots and experimented\n      a lot to design all those unique panels that fit together perfectly in forming an optimized vault structure. The journey\n      did not end there of course. The studio is developing software that drives industrial robots. It recently released\n      the first version of RAPCAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software that helps other designers to get started using\n      robots more easily. Through software, the studio transforms the research into more abstract and reusable workflows\n      and general algorithms. You can find more information on http://rapcam.eu. Studio RAP currently experiments with many\n      different techniques of manufacturing. This will allow the office to create even more amazing projects. Being probably\n      the first architectural office having programmers in the team, Studio RAP is moving fast to become a tech company.\n      I am very happy to witness such a transition and to have the opportunity to collaborate with this young start-up. I\n      hope that bringing professional knowledge of software development to the field of architecture will give a positive\n      effect to our built environment.\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>To conclude, I hope I managed to explain what it means to innovate in architectural sector nowadays.

This opens very interesting possibilities\n      for non-blocking canvas model architecture. Currently Grasshopper is built with the idea of synchronously executing\n      streams of computing blocks, but component can also execute parallel tasks. Such methodology allows not only for multithreaded\n      computing, but also for calls to be made to REST endpoints or other types of web services. In this blog post I will\n      explain my findings when dealing with such async components for RAPCAM.\n    </p>\n    <p>As .Net 4 and current Grasshopper implementation puts some limitations on asynchronous tasks, one should be careful when\n      implementing such solutions, but let’s just begin with some basic pseudocode for SolveInstance method\n    </p>\n    <pre>\n    <code class="cs">\n    {{codeSample}}\n  </code>\n  </pre>\n    <p>As you can see there are some implications for simplicity in such a component. I was not able to use DA.SetData directly\n      in RanToCompletion code block as it left dependant components unable to receive resolved data (resultPolyline). The\n      only working solution was to expire both the solution and active canvas document when task was finished. This triggers\n      SolveInstance again with the different state, reflected by skipSolution boolean and solved resultPolyline. All dependent\n      components then are able to pick up resulting polyline and correctly recompute. This does not seem to affect unrelated\n      components.\n    </p>\n    <p>Gap logic had to be disabled as that was forcing my component to output branched list of null and polyline values. By\n      changing Nickname of component one can easily inform the user that component is executing. It is of course possible\n      to add nice spinners or other progress indicators when writing such components, but it was not my intention to do such\n      a thing.\n    </p>\n    <p>componentBusy variable allows to protect component from recomputing itself when context changes. This can be improved\n      with richer state mechanism, which could allow in some specific situations to cancel the thread and recalculate solution,\n      etc.\n    </p>\n    <figure>\n      <img src="/assets/blog-images/async-grasshopper-components/rapcam-roughning.gif" alt="rapcam roughning" width="100%">\n      <figcaption>Rapcam roughing</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n      This example gif shows the principle and actual implications of such component. As you can see, thread does not block user\n      interface. No external components get corrupt. Component isolates it’s own state till calculation is finished. User\n      is thus able to use rhino and grasshopper further while calculation is done.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Using multiple interdependant components would require more complex state mechanism, but this shows the principle without\n      overcomplicating the idea. It was not my intention to give all the answers here as I have not yet delved into all the\n      consequences of such architecture, rather I prefer to introduce the idea of async component and ask community to reflect\n      on it. We should be critical about such a pattern, but its’ performance implications are hard to neglect.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</app-blog-post>'},817:function(e,n){e.exports='<div class="jumbotron">\n  <img src="/assets/cover.png" width="100%" />\n</div>\n\n<div class="row marketing">\n  <div class="col-lg-6">\n    <div routerLink="angular-meets-electron">\n      <app-angular-meets-electron [isSummary]="true"></app-angular-meets-electron>\n    </div>\n    <div routerLink="async-grasshopper-components">\n      <app-async-grasshopper-components [isSummary]="true"></app-async-grasshopper-components>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class="col-lg-6">\n    <div routerLink="arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation">\n      <app-arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation [isSummary]="true"></app-arc-innovation-award-tech-innovation>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>'},848:function(e,n,t){e.exports=t(480)}},[848]);
